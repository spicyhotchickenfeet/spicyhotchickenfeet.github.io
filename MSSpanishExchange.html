      <h1>MS Spanish Exchange</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">The Middle School Spanish Exchange programme is open to all 7th and 8th grade students that are studying Spanish. If more places are available, native Spanish speakers can join as well. The programme consists of two parts: in October there is a trip to Sant Cugat del Vallès near Barcelona, where students stay with the families of their exchange partners for a week. During the school days we participate in a mixture of Spanish lessons, other activities and field trips. In May, our exchange partners visit us here in Stavanger and follow a similar programme, staying with our families.</h5>
