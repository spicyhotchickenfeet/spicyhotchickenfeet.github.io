      <h1>Swimming</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">Competitive swimming is a highly popular co-curricular activity offered in many schools. It is an endurance sport that requires swimmers to race in various strokes such as freestyle, backstroke, breaststroke and butterfly over different distances. Participating in a school swim team can offer students many benefits, including opportunities to develop physical fitness, mental toughness, and self-discipline. Additionally, competing against other schools can foster a sense of school spirit and pride. Many schools also have a tradition of swimming rivalry with other schools, creating a sense of community and healthy competition. Overall, competitive swimming is a great way for students to stay active, make friends, and develop important life skills.</h5>
