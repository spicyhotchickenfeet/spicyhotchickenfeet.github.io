      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">Football (soccer) is a popular co-curricular activity in schools around the world. It is a team sport that requires players to work together to score goals and defend their own goal. Participating in a school football team can offer students many benefits, including opportunities to develop teamwork and communication skills, physical fitness, and self-discipline. Additionally, competing against other schools can foster a sense of school spirit and pride. Many schools also have a tradition of football rivalry with other schools, creating a sense of community and healthy competition. Overall, football is a great way for students to stay active, make friends, and develop important life skills.</h5>
