      <h1>MS Musical</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">The Middle School Musical is a co-curricular activity which is open to all Middle School students, and all students are encouraged to be involved in whatever way they are comfortable contributing. While much of the production requires an after-school commitment, the project is generally organized around the Middle School exploratory program, through which students may select an area of interest from a range of options, including cast, backstage, design, art, lighting & sound, costumes or front of house. This organizational structure allows students to choose their level of involvement while still actively contributing to the whole. All areas of the production offer opportunities for students to develop life skills, including collaborative group skills, organizational and self-management skills, critical thinking skills, and problem solving skills, all while having a great time and working as an extended team to create something that is truly their own. </h5>
