      <h1>MS/HS Board and Role Playing Club</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">The MS/HS Board and Role Playing Club provides our student community with a structured social activity where all students can feel comfortable and included. At ISS we recognize that sometimes it can be difficult for students to adjust to living in a new country and joining a new school and we strive to make our club a place where students can come to connect with peers and develop, use and grow various skill sets in both competitive and collaborative game settings. Currently each club meeting lasts for approximately one hour. During that time we ask club members to put away any technology or media players and instead focus on interacting with their peers, face to face, without the pressures that come from other social and academic activities. </h5>
