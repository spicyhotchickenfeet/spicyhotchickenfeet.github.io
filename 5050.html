      <h1>50:50</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">50:50 is a high school club run by students to work towards gender equality. Over the past years, 50:50 has raised awareness and funds to combat gender inequality within education, inequality due to the pandemic, violations of healthcare rights, and many other issues. Some charities that 50:50 has supported in the past include Plan International, Equality Now, UNAIDS, Brystkreftforeningen, and many others. 50:50 offers a place for all students to collaborate within a large team, undertake leadership roles through the elected executive team,  and make a positive impact on the global community. 50:50's initiatives, like its annual Talent Show, are opportunities to spotlight global issues and unite the school community to work toward a better future.</h5>
