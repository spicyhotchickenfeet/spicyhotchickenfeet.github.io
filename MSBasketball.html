      <h1>MS Boys / Girls Basketball</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">Basketball is a highly popular co-curricular activity offered in many schools. It is a team sport that requires players to work together to score points by shooting a ball through a hoop that is mounted high on a wall. Participating in a school basketball team can offer students many benefits, including opportunities to develop teamwork and communication skills, physical fitness, and self-discipline. Additionally, competing against other schools can foster a sense of school spirit and pride. Many schools also have a tradition of basketball rivalry with other schools, creating a sense of community and healthy competition. Overall, basketball is a great way for students to stay active, make friends, and develop important life skills.</h5>
