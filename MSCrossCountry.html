      <h1>MS HS Boys / Girls Cross Country</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">Cross country running is a highly popular co-curricular activity offered in many schools. It is an endurance sport that requires runners to race on a course that typically covers a variety of terrain such as grass, dirt, gravel, and hills. Participating in a school cross country team can offer students many benefits, including opportunities to develop physical fitness, mental toughness, and self-discipline. Additionally, competing against other schools can foster a sense of school spirit and pride. Many schools also have a tradition of cross country rivalry with other schools, creating a sense of community and healthy competition. Overall, cross country running is a great way for students to stay active, make friends, and develop important life skills.</h5>
