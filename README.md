This is a website created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The website is created with the purpose of allowing students to find information about 
extra-curricular activites offered at my school along with personality quizzes that reccomend specififc activities based on the students' responses. 

Here is the link to the website: https://spicyhotchickenfeet.github.io/

I have used the code from "Harry potter personality quiz" made by joshuabarper7 and changed the questions, results and styling of elements. 
I have also edited the templates from w3schools for my home page from (https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/w3css_templates.asp)
