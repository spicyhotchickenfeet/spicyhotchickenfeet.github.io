      <h1>MS Girls Volleyball</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">Volleyball is a highly popular co-curricular activity offered in many schools. It is a team sport that requires players to work together to pass, set, and spike the ball over the net in order to score points. Participating in a school volleyball team can offer students many benefits, including opportunities to develop teamwork and communication skills, physical fitness, and self-discipline. In Middle School Volleyball, students focus on playing a game of mini volleyball where skills can be developed in a mini-game competition.Overall, volleyball is a great way for students to stay active, make friends, and develop important life skills. </h5>
